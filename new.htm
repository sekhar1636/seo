       Staff Tech Design Applicants can post their audio, video and pictures on the portfolio section of 
      their application for no charge. Send your files to jayhat@strawhat-auditions.com. 
      
      </P>
      
      <P STYLE="font-size: 11pt">The StrawHat application process opens <b>November 1st</b> 
        to give everyone enough time to apply. We have 
        streamlined the acceptance process so that applicants will be notified 
        faster once the applications have been received. We continue to upgrade 
        our online application process for actors and staff tech design candidates, 
        which makes the online applications easy to start, edit and finish. Our database 
        includes advanced searches for actors and searches for 
        staff tech. Actors and staff tech can  
        post audio and video for review by our theatres.</P>
<!--
      <P STYLE="font-size: 11pt">One of the really fun benefits of registering 
        with the StrawHat Auditions is our growing relationship with the Actors 
        Studio MFA Program and the <i>Inside the Actors Studio</i> TV program, 
        both at Pace University. Last year StrawHat was able to offer registered 
        actors deeply discounted tickets to the taping of the series. Actors featured 
        in past seasons included Dustin Hoffman, Don Cheadle, Teri Hatcher, Forest 
        Whitaker, Eddie Murphy, Kyra Sedgewick and Matt Damon! <i>(Please note: 
        ticket offers are only made to actors that have completed their applications 
        online, sent their materials in and paid the registration fee). </i></P> -->
		
      <P STYLE="font-size: 11pt">We tape the auditions. Attending theatres will 
        be able to review auditions as needed, auditioning companies that cannot 
        attend can still review the auditions and finally, actors can get a copy 
        of their audition for submission for projects in the future. </P>
      <P STYLE="font-size: 11pt">Another benefit for actors that get 10 or more 
        callbacks is our mailing to personal managers, agents and casting directors 
        after the auditions, listing all the actors that have done so well and 
        directing them to our site to review their pictures and resumes.</P>
        
      <P STYLE="font-size: 11pt">
        The audition selection process and the work we do putting your pictures 
        and resumes online gives us an opportunity to get to know all of you better. 
        We do our best to see all the auditions. As a result, StrawHat applicants 
        got jobs this year through our conversations with the theatres and our 
        recommendations to them. Take a moment to read a letter from actor Jessie Galvan:<BR>
        <BR>
        <font size="-1"><i>Through the StrawHats I was offered a job at The New 
        Harmony Theatre in New Harmony, Indiana. But wait, here's the cool part. 
        I got the job based on the recommendation of the awesome people at StrawHat... 
        the artistic director of the New Harmony Theatre was not present on the 
        day of my audition. but the people at StrawHats saw my audition and recommended 
        me and I was offered a job the next day over the phone.</i> <BR>

        to membership services at StrawHat-Auditions.com. This includes: </P>
