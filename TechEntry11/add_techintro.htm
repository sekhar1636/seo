<p> <b>Welcome to the StrawHat Staff/Tech/Design On-Line Registration.</b> 
  Both Equity and non-Equity theatres from across the country use our online service 
  to hire designers, administrators, stage managers, musical directors, box office 
  staff, and technicians. StrawHat   registration services are open to anyone interested 
  in a career in the performing arts. Registration is restricted to non-Equity performers
  and stage technicians 18 years of age or older. 
  </p>

<p>In addition to posting technical resumes on our website at www.strawhat-auditions.com, 
  we also post designer portfolios. By posting your resume as soon as we receive 
  your completed application, our participating theatres can contact you directly 
  to discuss your resume and portfolio when the most jobs are available. The website 
  has been praised by our theaters, who review your resumes, do their interviewing 
  by phone, and hire many of you on the spot! You will also have access to the 
  StrawHat job listings file, informing you of what positions are available at 
  hiring theatres as well as detailed information about them -- including direct 
  links to their web sites (where available). StrawHat-auditions.com gives you 
  the jump on distributing your resume.</p>
  
<p>Your resume will appear online at www.strawhat-auditions.com in our Staff/Tech/Design 
  database free of charge. In addition to the online listing, you can post a portfolio 
  of (3) examples of your work. Directors and Choreographers 
  may provide video; Designers (Set, Scenic Design, Lighting, Costumes, etc.) 
  may add photos, renderings and/or video. Musical Directors and Accompanists 
  may also provide audio or video. </p>
