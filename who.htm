      <P><I><font size="-1">"Of all the auditions you can do this spring -- put 

        StrawHat at the top of your list! The caliber of the theatres represented, 

        the caring staff, and the overall quality of the audition experience from 

        initial song and monologue to dance call to call backs truly makes StrawHat 

        a class act. ... I ended up doing the kind of theatre I dreamed of while 

        in grad school. StrawHat opened doors that validated me not just as a 

        musical theatre performer, but as an actor, making all the training worth 

        it! (Not to mention I got my Equity card!)"</font></I><font size="-1"><BR>

      <P STYLE="font-size: 11pt"><STRONG>StrawHat</STRONG> is an organization 

        that supports the careers of <STRONG>non-equity</STRONG> actors and technical 

        artists looking to start and continue their professional careers in the 

        theatre. Its main activity is to produce the StrawHat Auditions, which 

        are held in New York every spring. Over three days, over 750 actors and 

        "techies" and staff from over forty theatres attend. Actors audition for 

        available positions in the theaters' summer seasons while technical people 

        post their resumes and portfolios online and arrange phone or onsite interviews.<BR>

        <BR>

        StrawHat's website has become an important addition to the auditions. 

        Every year over 1,000,000 visitors learn more about summer stock theatres, 

        review the thousands of actor and technical resumes on our site.</P>

      <P STYLE="font-size: 11pt">The theatres who attend the auditions produce 

        everything from melodrama to plays, history fairs to musicals. Most are 

        summer stock theatres, but some are regionals that run year round. They 

        are looking for dancers, leading players, chorus, techies. All types, 

        all sizes, all genders, all colors. All skills. </P> 

			 

      <P STYLE="font-size: 11pt">StrawHat is run by people who have worked on 

        Broadway and/or in many of the major theatres in the US. We believe the 

        best way to start a career in the theatre is to work in the theatre. Learning 

        your craft. Putting in the hours. Meeting and working with people who 

        do this for a living. And having the time of your life.</P>
