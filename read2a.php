<H1>What Should I Be Reading? - continued</H1>

<H2>BOOKS EVERY ACTOR SHOULD OWN - Or At Least Read</H2>
<P>The list of books about auditioning and acting are innumerable, so we won't even attempt a comprehensive list here. If you were to visit the web sites of Amazon, Barnes & Noble, or The Drama Bookshop - just to name a few - and search for "auditions" as subject matter in the performing arts section, you'd spend hours reading the synopses and online reviews. Below are just three that we happen to like very much:</P>


<P><b>AUDITION</b> <BR>Michael Shurtleff. Walker and Company, 1978. ISBN: 0-8027-0590-1.<BR><BR> 
  This book has been the audition bible since it was first published in 1978. 
  From the dust jacket: "AUDITION describes every conceivable auditioning situation 
  and how to handle it. Michael Shurtleff is the expert…He was actually there 
  when Barbra Streisand, Robert Redford, Ben Vereen, Lily Tomlin, Dustin Hoffman 
  and many more got their first break … He has been the casting director for dozens 
  of Broadway shows and films… Absolutely everything an actor needs to know to 
  get the part is here - from role playing down to how to dress for the audition. 
  The book covers what to do that moment before, how to use humor, create mystery 
  and secret, how to develop a distinct style, and how to evaluate the place, 
  the relationships and the competition."</P>

<P><b>THE AUDITION SOURCEBOOK</b> <BR>
  Randall Richardson, Don Sandley. Heinemann, 2002. ISBN: 0-325-00335-1<BR><BR>
   This book with tips on auditioning is hot off the 
  press, as you can see by the publication date. Richardson & Sandley are both 
  on the faculty at Samford University, and have focused this book on providing 
  information to the young and aspiring performer with solid ground rules of selecting 
  material, rehearsing that material for audition purposes, preparing a proper 
  theatrical resume, etc, with an emphasis on tips and advice for combined auditions. 
  The authors spent time in attendance at the SETCs, and yes, spoke with us at 
  StrawHat, too. They've got a friendly, intelligent and straight-forward way 
  of writing which is pleasurable to read, and an interesting "hook" - they have 
  developed a companion web site to the book that includes over 2000 monologue 
  and musical excerpts to guide folks towards audition material.</P>

<P><b>AN ACTOR BEHAVES</b><BR>
  Tom Markus. Samuel French Trade, 1992. ISBN 0-573-69901-1.<BR><BR>
  Order from any bookstore. This unique, well-written guide discusses looking 
  for work, preparing for auditions, auditioning, salary negotiation, agents, 
  rehearsal politics, understudying, daily work patterns, reviews, touring, training, 
  and a wealth of other related topics gathered under the broad headings of Auditions, 
  Rehearsals, Performances, and Between Engagements. As it says on the back cover, 
  "Talented, well-trained actors lose jobs or fail to get jobs because they lack 
  an appropriately professional attitude and proper work habits. AN ACTOR BEHAVES 
  offers the actor good, nuts-and-bolts advice on professional behavior--career 
  etiquette." A young actress wrote an endorsement that ends:... basically, it 
  all comes down to Respect. To paraphrase Mr. Markus-- for the people, for the 
  space, for the time, for oneself."</P>
