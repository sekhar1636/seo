<P><b><a name="apps">What is the deadline for actor applications?</a></b><br>

<b>Application deadline is February 1st. This means that ALL materials &#8211; email and hard copy &#8211; must be delivered to our office by NOON of that day.</b> 
If you are using a courier, be sure they can confirm delivery on that day. Better yet, apply early!</p>

<P><b><A NAME="types">What are the different types of auditions?</A></b><br>

There are 4 types of auditions: Song and Monologue, Monologue Only, Dancers Who Sing, and a set number of Stand-By appointments for each day.   <a href="aud_type.pdf" target="myNewWin" onClick="sendme()"

<P><b><A NAME="2different">Can I apply for two different types of audition?</A></b><br>

No, you should apply for the category where you can present yourself at your best.</p>

<P><b><A NAME="drive">What is a self-addressed stamped #10 envelope?</A></b><br> 

A business-size envelope fits a standard piece of paper folded in thirds and requires only a single USPS Forever Stamp for delivery.

<P><b><A NAME="brook">Why should the picture I use be of professional quality? Is it OK to send laser copies?</A></b><br>      
Every actor who registers for StrawHat has an online profile that includes picture and resume.  Those profile pages are used to create the audition directories that the producers use during the audition. Your picture is your calling card and it should be of good quality to present you at your best. Plain paper laser copies should <i>only</i> be used as a last resort. Your submission should be as professional as possible. Read our advice on head shots in the Actor Application section.</P>

<P><b><a name="received">How can I be sure StrawHat has received my application materials?</a></b><br>
Once we activate your online profile, every time you log 
  into the Members Area you will be greeted with a screen that states your name 
  and your status: i.e. &quot;Your registration was accepted on (date of activation)&quot; 
  and once selected to audition, your greeting screen will tell you that, too. 
  You will also receive a confirmation letter in the mail via the first of the 
  two self-addressed, stamped envelopes you provided with your application.</p>

<P><b><a name="status">How long before I hear about my application/audition status?</a></b><br>
Typically, it takes 2 to 4 weeks to activate your Member 
  registration and make a determination on your application for an audition. However, 
  with the volume of mail we receive, it can take longer. Every application is 
  given consideration, and there are times when we are unwilling to make an immediate 
  decision either for or against a candidate: in those cases, a second and even 
  third assessment are made.</p>

        <H3>Members Area Answers</H3>

<P><b><a name="membarea">I can&#8217;t access the Members Area. What do I do? </a></b><br>
You do not have access to the Members Area until we have received your complete application and we activate your account.

<P><b><a name="audstatus">How long does it take for me to find out if I get an audition? </a></b><br>

We do or very best to make a determination on all applications within 4 weeks of activating registration. However, sometimes there are delays, usually due to mail volume. Apply early for faster processing. </p>

<P><b><a name="daytime">How do I find out my audition day and time?</a></b><br>

When you are scheduled for an appointment, we email you a notice and mail you a confirmation sheet with all the pertinent information using the second self-addressed 
  stamped envelope you provided. We also post an alphabetical list of scheduled actors in the Members Area of the web site once the schedule is set. You can use this list to confirm your appointment day and time.</p>

<P><b><a name="friend"> I have to cancel.  Can I give my appointment to a friend? </a></b><br>

<b>No.</b> All actors that get an audition are pre-screened. Your audition

<P><b><a name="long"> How long is the audition day?</a></b><br>

First audition is at 10:00 am every morning, and general auditions end at 6:00. 
After that is the dance teaching and dance call, then individual theatre callbacks can run 
as late as 11:00 pm. On the last day of the event only, Dancers Who Sing learn their dance call 
at 1:00 pm, then their auditions start at 2:00 pm for the hour.</p>

<P><b><a name="weekend">Do I have to be there for the whole weekend? </a></b><br>

Nope! Your whole audition is completed in a single day. If you get a lot of callbacks, 
it&#8217;s a really long day, but it&#8217;s all done in a single day. </p>

<P><b><a name="park">If I drive, can I park near the auditions? </a></b><br>

If you are from out of town and you have to drive, okay. But if you can avoid it, do. The 
auditions are easy to get to by subway, 10 minutes from Mid-town, and city driving is a hassle. <b>If you do drive, we recommend parking in a garage</b>, but be sure to confirm their operating hours, since our nights can go pretty late.</p>

<P><b><a name="stopwatch">How do we time your audition? </a></b><br>

We time your audition from the first word of your monologue or the first note of the piano,

<P><b><A name="dreadlist">Why a list of what NOT to do? </a></b><br>

Many of the songs and monologues cited on the Dreaded List (visit the Articles section of the 
Members Area) are so popular that lots of people do them. The same day, sometimes the same hour. 
Choosing over-used material puts you at a disadvantage. Take the opportunity to do a little 
research and come up with material that will be your own. But, we STRONGLY recommend you stay 
away from obscene or graphic material. We promise you, it&#8217;s a turn-off.</p>

<P><b><a name="shakes"> Should I do a Shakespeare monologue? </a></b><br>
Are you trained in classical theatre? If you are auditioning with two contrasting monologues, 
you can choose to contrast with classic/contemporary or with comedy/drama. It&#8217;s up to you 
to <i>select pieces that show you at your best.</i> For musical theatre auditions, 
you <i>can</i> do Shakespeare for your speech but it may be more appropriate for you to do a 
speech from a contemporary play &#8211; chances are that companies doing musicals are more 
likely to have a Neil Simon play in their season rather than Hamlet. </p>

Our accompanists are professional accompanist/vocal coach/musical directors who specialize in 
musical theatre. You are in good hands, as long as you come ready to communicate and with your 
music prepared as suggested in our preparation advice.</p>

<P><b><A NAME="piano">Can I bring my own accompanist?</A></b><br> 

Of course! But save yourself any anxiety and be sure he/she has directions, arrives on time to 
meet you (meaning well ahead of your scheduled appointment time) and stays with you through the 
audition. You have enough to think about without worrying if your accompanist is going to show up.</p>

<P><b>A thought to make you feel good</b><br>
<p><b>If you received an audition time</b>, you were accepted from over a thousand other 
applications.           
You&#8217;ll audition for a whole lot of theaters, make new theater contacts, be called back 
and perhaps get a job, all in one day! StrawHat is an event that attracts lots of theater
 producers, directors, casting directors, etc. &#8211; and sometimes even a few who are not 
 formally registered. Every one of us watching the auditions is eager to discover exciting new 
 talent for the upcoming season. Have a great audition &#8211; we&#8217;re glad to have you 
 with us!</p>

<p><FONT FACE="Arial">Typically, it takes 2 to 4 weeks to activate your Member 
  registration and make a determination on your application for an audition. However, 
  with the volume of mail we receive, it can take longer. Every application is 
  given consideration, and there are times when we are unwilling to make an immediate 
  decision either for or against a candidate: in those cases, a second and even 
  third assessment are made.</FONT></p>

<p><b>There are no walk-ins.</b> No one attends the auditions without an appointment.<font face="Arial"> 
  We have always run the auditions this way.<br>
  <br>
  Stand-by slots are available, but are strictly limited. If you indicate that 
  you will accept a stand-by appointment, you will be scheduled for one of the 
  days you indicated on your application. Standbys receive confirmation of their 
  audition day, just like a regular audition. You must be available for the entire 
  audition day, as you will step in at short notice to take the place of a cancellation 
  or &quot;no show&quot;. <b>Stand-bys who check in for their appointed audition 
  are guaranteed an audition</b> and their pictures and resumes will appear in 
  that day&#8217;s book. <br>
  <br>
  Only selected actors who have received a confirmation come in on stand-by.<br>

<P>It is a technology age, so perhaps many of you do not know what this is. Once 
  upon a time, there was an institution called the Post Office... okay, couldn&#8217;t 
  resist. When you send us a self addressed stamped #10 envelope, please do the 
  following:</P> 
	 <UL> 
		<LI><FONT FACE="Arial">The size of an number #10 envelope is 9-1/2" long
		  by 4" high. They also call it a business envelope. Please use this size: not
		  smaller, not larger.</FONT></LI> 
		<LI><FONT FACE="Arial">The stamp goes in the upper right hand
		  corner.</FONT></LI> 
		
  <LI><FONT FACE="Arial">When you self address an envelope, you put your name 
    and address <B>in the center; AND in the upper left hand corner. </B>It is 
    addressed to you and it is from you.</FONT></LI>
		
		
  <LI><FONT FACE="Arial">We know you think we are kidding, but we see a lot of 
    applications with the wrong addressing... remember, these carry your confirmations, 
    so it is important.</FONT></LI>

<P>Every actor who registers for StrawHat gets their picture, profile and resume 
  online. Those who are chosen to audition have 8X10 picture and full resumes 
  printed in books that the producers use during the audition. The point is that 
  your picture is seen alot, and it should be of good quality to "compete" with 
  others of good quality.</P>
<P>We prefer black and white photos to color, but either will do. We scan and 
  print our books in black and white. As for laser copies, they should only be 
  used as a last resort. The quality is usually poor for scanning and print and 
  if we don&#8217;t think the are good enough, your application may not be considered.</P>

  <P><A NAME="minutes"><b>What happens if I send you just a picture and resume?</b></A></P>
<P>Nothing. We only accept complete applications.<br>

<P>Sure, no problem. But if you bring your own accompanist, do yourself a favor 
  and make sure he/she arrives on time to meet you, and stays with you through 
  the audition. You have enough to think about without running around wondering 
  where your accompanist is. Our accompanists have been great, Broadway caliber; 
  and as long as it isn&#8217;t something a Julliard student would take the morning 
  to read, you have adequate backup.<br>
