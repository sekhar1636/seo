  <p>... or anything from a musical libretto, especially Bobby from A Chorus Line, Guinevere walking naked through Camelot, any of the murderesses from "Cell Block Tango" in Chicago, The Girl brushing her hair in The Fantasticks, and "I am Gypsy Rose Lee" from - well you know what that's from...</p>

<p>For musical theatre performers, you have the choice of doing any kind of monologue 
  you like in contrast with your song. It is beneficial for singers to do a monologue 
  from a play, not from a musical. It's a minor detail, but if a very good singer 
  chooses a speech from a musical, there arises the question of whether that performer 
  is taking the acting part of his training seriously: you need to read plays, 
  too, not just watch movie musicals and listen to cast albums! </p>
