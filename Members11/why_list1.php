<h1>Why "The Dreaded List?"</h1>
<h2>Over-used Songs & Monologues and Why You Should Avoid Them<br><br>
  <font size="3"><b>At the request of many of the participating theatres, we offer 
  the following suggestions in choosing your audition material for StrawHat:</b></font></h2>
<p>Up-tempo pieces are encouraged, and a boffo 16 bars will leave us wanting more. 
  Perfect.<br>
  Do not do pieces from plays with titles you can't pronounce (&quot;Lapin Agile&quot;, 
  anyone?).<br>
  Please avoid speeches that are directly sexual in content or intent.<br>
  Shakespeare is not typically produced in summer theatre, and therefore may not 
  be your best choice for combined auditions.<br>
  The question arose last season: &quot;Why are all these women so <i>angry</i>?&quot;<br>
</p>
<p>Casting representatives at combined auditions end up seeing 2,000 or more performers 
  each season. Imagine being one of those reps. Wouldn't you prefer to hear something 
  well-presented that you haven't heard six times already today? If it's a popular 
  enough piece for six people to do it today, doesn't that suggest the possibility 
  that six people have sung it every other day this audition season, let alone 
  in past years?</p>
<p>As we often say, you should perform it if you do it brilliantly! But the caveat 
  is this: if you are brilliant at this piece, you're probably every bit as capable 
  of knocking our socks off with something less-often heard. Demonstrate that 
  you take time in preparing your audition -- not just in the performance of your 
  selections, but in researching and choosing your selections to begin with. If 
  there is no question that this song is superior to anything else in showing 
  you at your very best, by all means do it. </p>
<p>By the same token, if it's a piece you love but doesn't really show you to 
  your best, you should be searching for something else that let's your light 
  shine brighter. A perfectly fine rendition of an over-worked song can end up 
  being dismissed just due to fatigue on the auditors' part ("Oh no, not that 
  one again!" and we turn off our ears), whereas another choice might make an 
  auditor perk up ("Hey! I haven't heard that one in ages - I love that song!").</p>
<p>While it is not an explicit rule, we would simply urge you <u>for your own sake</u> to find alternatives to the following severely over-used musical selections:</p>

<P>In fact, you should probably beware of singing anything predictable from Annie, 
  Baby, Secret Garden, Children of Eden, the movie Fame, Godspell, Newsies, Thoroughly 
  Modern Millie, Phantom of the Opera, any Disney animated film produced since 
  1986, and anything from an original cast album released within the past two 
  years. </p>
<p>We also strongly suggest that for combined audition purposes you avoid material 
  by Stephen Sondheim and the newer musical theatre composers, i.e. Michael John 
  LaChuisa, Ricky Ian Gordon, et al. Although these composers are highly respected 
  and popular, their material is difficult to perform even under the best of circumstances, 
  as they often comprise difficult and/or multiple time signatures and complex 
  passages with extensive arpeggios. Bear in mind the physical conditions:</p>
<ol>
<li>You will have at best 30 seconds or so to speak with the accompanist about tempi, cuts, etc. (See our web article on tips for prepping your music). </li>
  <li>The piano is positioned off-stage and behind you when you audition - the 
    pianist cannot see your face, nor can you make eye-contact with him should 
    there be a problem. </li>
  <li>As the auditions take place on a stage, the accompanist is using only a dim 
    music lamp on the piano to read by. Thus, very "black" music (meaning lots 
    and lots of notes to be played - extensive arpeggios, etc.) is extremely difficult 
    to read. </li>
<li>Complex, obscure music can distract us from listening to you as opposed to evaluating the song itself.  If the auditors are busy wondering what the piece is and whether they like it or not, they aren't paying much attention to you as a performer.</li>
</ol>
<p>A final note on this: let's face it, in summer stock you are far more likely 
  to be performing in Oklahoma! or My Fair Lady than in Marie Christine or Parade. 
  There are thousands upon thousands of standard musical theatre pieces that show 
  range, emotion, versatility, humor, legato - the works! That's why the material 
  is classic. And if you can inhabit a beloved standard and make it your own, 
  you are a long way toward proving yourself as a performer to be reckoned with. 
  SO, sing the song that's right for you, not the song for the role you think 
  you're right for.</p>
