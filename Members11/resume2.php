<H1>Resumes - continued</H1>
<P><b>Additional Details:</b></P>
<P><u>List your credits in chronological order</u>, with the most recent roles 
  in each category coming first. As you edit, you may want to take different extenuating 
  factors into account - you may want to keep an older credit that was for a renowned 
  organization or director, versus a newer credit may not have been very successful 
  (or perhaps even an experience you'd like to forget!). Use your best judgment 
  - and ask the opinion of a mentor or colleague. </P>

<P><u>Larger point sizes can boost the visual impact</u> of your resume. Use a 
  larger scale for your name and for the category headings, and/or explore using 
  the "bold" feature for the same. Experiment with using all capital letters as 
  well as traditional upper and lower cases. Be advised that using anything larger 
  than 14 point for the credits themselves points up the fact that there's only 
  a handful of things on the page.</P>

<P><u>List directors on your resume that you worked with in college or professional 
  theater</u>. You should list directors you worked with professionally, and those 
  you think are important in your educational credits. It's helpful to casting 
  directors who know alot more people than you think and it adds to the content 
  of your resume.</P>
<P><u>Education</u>: State your college/university and level of training: &quot;Emerson 
  University BFA Musical Theatre, 2008&quot; or &quot;BA in Theatre Arts expected 
  2010.&quot;</P>
<P><u>Dance</u> disciplines should be listed with the number of years you have 
  studied.</P>
<P><u>Special Skills</u> are just that: SPECIAL. Do not list beginner or basic 
  level acheivements. This category is for things you do with proficiency that 
  may be of use or interest: Fluent in Italian; Certified in Stage Combat; Figure 
  Skating (10 years); Trapeze (Barnum &amp; Bailey Circus School, 2005); Trombone, 
  12 years. Get the idea?</P>
<P><u>Does your resume looks a little too thin</u>? Rule Number One: Don't Lie! 
  You will be amazed as you go through your career to learn just how many people 
  know seemingly everybody. Certainly in a combined audition situation, you can 
  be guaranteed that representatives are chatting over coffee on breaks - and 
  if they see you've worked for another theatre there, they'll take the opportunity 
  to ask about you. Six Degrees of Separation is more than just the title of a 
  John Guare play - it's a fact of theatre life. Don't get caught in an untruth 
  - it's embarrassing and implies a weakness of character.</P>

<p>The jury is split on the <u>use of early credits on resumes</u>: it's your 
  decision. One faculty advisor we know strongly recommends that high school credits 
  disappear once a performer is in a good college training program with a credit 
  or two under his/her belt. <u>At StrawHat</u>, it helps us to know that you 
  played leads all through high school, even though as a sophomore in college 
  you've only had two ensemble roles. All of those shows reflect the fact that 
  you have been gaining stage experience and have had an interest in performing 
  for some years, even if your actual opportunities have been strictly educational.</P>

<P>Remember that you can always adjust the layout you choose to reflect the needs 
  of your audition. You should have different resumes for TV, film and theatre: 
  a resume with TV and film listed before their theatre credits when pursuing 
  SAG or AFTRA work, with the categories reversed when auditioning for Broadway 
  and other theatre companies. In addition, a theatre performer who has an extended 
  body of work in both musicals and in 'straight' plays might have two different 
  resumes, one ordered for plays and the other for musicals.</P>

<P><b>Following are two examples of typical resume layouts</b> - easy to read, 
  straight forward, and providing all the information necessary for a casting 
  director or producer to determine your qualifications. All you need to do now 
  is be brilliant in your audition, and you're on your way to adding another credit 
  to the top of the page!</P>
