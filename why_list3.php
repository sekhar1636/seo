<H1>Why "The List?" (continued)</H1>

<h2>Non-Singing Auditions</h2>

<p>For those doing two monologues, remember that you are not required to do a classical verse piece as one of your offerings; a contemporary piece can contrast something from Ibsen or Chekov, or a comedic piece can contrast a dramatic piece instead.  So if Shakespeare and Marlowe are outside your comfort zone, don't feel that you are obligated to attempt them.</p>

<p>On the classical monologue front, we are fully aware that most speeches seem over-used - after all, Shakespeare's plays are 400 years old!  Still, here's the short list of over-worked stuff:</p>

<p>Launce, Edmund, Lancelot Gobbo, both Lord and Lady MacB, Portia, Helena, Viola, Romeo, and Juliet.  The St. Crispin's Day speech is tough, and Hamlet is risky even for the best.  Two Noble Kinsmen has gotten a workout lately, and Julia's tearing up the letter from Two Gentlemen of Verona is messy because you have to pick up all those little pieces of paper when you're done.  Some people advise against trying to create a Shakespeare piece by editing, others would rather see that than innumerable Juliets. </p>

<h2>Final observations from our office:</h2>

<p><i>We strongly recommend that you avoid performing graphic speeches</i> about ovarian or breast cancer, dead, dying, squashed, burned, tortured, or mutilated puppies, frogs, goldfish, butterflies, lightning bugs, porcupines, peacocks, tonsils, children, agents, or whooping cranes.  In any event, speeches that are chosen intentionally to shock or disgust, such as those that require detailed descriptions or performances of vomiting, masturbation, etc. are NEVER well received.  And while we do not believe that any writer's work should be censored or expurgated, you should be aware that some casting representatives, like individuals in any audience, may be offended by excessive or aggressive profanity.  Remember - the auditors are sitting in that theatre for days on end and can feel trapped enough without being verbally assaulted.  Demonstrating the ability to curse with the best of Mamet or masturbate onstage does not show us acting ability, only excessive extroversion.</p>
<p><i>Be sure to read the entire play of a speech you've discovered in a monologue source book:</i> context of the original speech is important even when performed out-of-context.  For example, we often hear young women doing a selection from Frankie and Johnny in the Claire de Lune in which Frankie talks about her grandmother believing that sleeping in the moonlight would turn you into a werewolf, but "I thought if I slept in the moonlight I'd wake up a beautiful fairy princess."  A large part of the emotional weight of the piece comes from the fact that Frankie is nearly 40 years old and desperately lonely, confiding in a man who may or may not be more than a one-night stand.  It is not a dreamy and romantic speech - it is a piece exposing years of vulnerability and pain.  It isn't really age-appropriate for a twenty-year-old.  Another example is the opening speech from Jeffrey, where he confides in the audience that he's giving up sex in the age of AIDS because he's had more partners than he can count.  When an actor who is obviously only in his late teens or early twenties attempts this piece, we are pulled out of our focus in order to ponder how old he was when he started sleeping around - eight or nine???  Context and the age specifications of a character do come into play when choosing your material.</p>
<p><i>Speeches about auditioning, acting, or wanting to be an actor tends to show us one-dimension.</i>  We already know that you are or wish to be an actor!  Find a piece with which you can transfer that passion for performing to another objective.</p>

<p><i>Speeches that are narrative (talking about something that happened before)</i> are much less immediate or "in the moment" than those in which a character is imparting specific needs or information to another specific individual.  Acting is mustering and displaying current emotions, not describing something that happened in the past.</p>

<p><i>If you are capable of being funny - BE FUNNY!</i>  It is summer stock, after all and there's likely to be more Neil Simon than Sam Shepard.  If you're not funny, don't force yourself - just be focused, direct, and real. </p>

<p>We hope this sheds a little light on subject of StrawHat's dreaded - and infamous - List.</p>
