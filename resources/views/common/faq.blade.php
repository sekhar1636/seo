Those profile pages are used to create the audition directories that the producers use during the audition. Your picture is your calling card and it should be of good quality to present you at your best. Plain paper laser copies should only be used as a last resort. Your submission should be as professional as possible. Read our advice on head shots in the Actor Application section. </p>

                                        <p>Many of the songs and monologues cited on the Dreaded List (visit the Articles section of the Members Area) are so popular that lots of people do them. The same day, sometimes the same hour. Choosing over-used material puts you at a disadvantage. Take the opportunity to do a little research and come up with material that will be your own. But, we STRONGLY recommend you stay away from obscene or graphic material. We promise you, it’s a turn-off. </p>

                                        <p> Are you trained in classical theatre? If you are auditioning with two contrasting monologues, you can choose to contrast with classic/contemporary or with comedy/drama. It’s up to you to select pieces that show you at your best. For musical theatre auditions, you can do Shakespeare for your speech but it may be more appropriate for you to do a speech from a contemporary play – chances are that companies doing musicals are more likely to have a Neil Simon play in their season rather than Hamlet. </p>
