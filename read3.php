<H2>THEATRE HISTORY AND CRITICISM</H2>
<P>Learning more about the theatre's past brings depth and an added perspective to our work in the present. Knowledge 
  is power, and knowing the who and what of this business you love is important. 
  We're not talking about committing your Theatre History textbooks to memory, 
  but there is great and pleasurable reading available, by and about the people 
  creating the theatre of our recent past, the present and the future.</P>

<P><b>HOT SEAT: THEATRE CRITICISM FOR THE NEW YORK TIMES</b><BR>1980-1993 by Frank 
  Rich. Random House, 1998.<BR><BR>
	Frank Rich and The New York Times had a powerful influence over Broadway theatre during his tenure as senior critic. This book provides a glimpse into the recent past of theatre history: it provides a complete collection of Rich's reviews from the period - over 300! - along with editorial comments from the present looking back. </P>

<P><b>THE SEASON: A CANDID LOOK AT BROADWAY</b><BR>
  William Goldman. Harcourt Brace & Co. 1967.<BR><BR>
  This book covers all the events and productions of a season on Broadway, the openings, the reviews, the hits and the bombs - and what contributed to both, the union conflicts, the personal crises, and all told with the distinctive charm and style of Mr. Goldman. Yes, it's 30 years old, but the stories are playing out again and again every year with each new Broadway season. If you want to understand the whole of show business, not just the small part you play in trying to land the job in a Broadway show, you simply must read this book.</P>

<H2>PURELY FOR ENTERTAINMENT'S SAKE</H2>
<P> <b>NO TURN UNSTONED: THE WORST EVER THEATRICAL REVIEWS</b><BR>compiled by Diana 
  Rigg. First published 1982, paperback publication by Silman-James Press 1991 
  (currently out-of-print, but can be tracked down)<BR><BR>
  Diana Rigg, of "The Avengers" (the original TV show, not the film) and Olivier- 
  and Tony-Award winner for Medea, has gathered together the worst reviews of 
  all time for everything and everyone from 'Romeo and Juliet' and Sarah Bernhardt 
  to Alec Guinness and 'Evita'. They make compulsive - and devastatingly funny 
  - reading. Nobody would ever want to read stuff like this about themselves, 
  but it's comforting to know that even the best can have a really, really bad 
  opening night. </P>

<P><b>A NOVEL APPROACH TO THEATRE</b><BR>Linda Sarver and Tom Markus. Scarecrow Press, 
  Inc. 1997. ISBN: 0-8108-3251-8<BR> <BR>
  Order from any bookstore or by phone from 
  1-800-462-6420. This book is by two theatre junkies who love to read novels 
  about the theatre and couldn't find a convenient guide to the books they wanted 
  to discover. So they wrote one that provides over 600 descriptions of novels 
  that have theatrical settings or in which the inhabitants work in the theatre. 
  The authors have included all the novels they could find that love the theatre 
  as much as they do. A NOVEL APPROACH TO THEATRE is a user-friendly book that 
  arranges the entries in eight categories: Bio-novels, Classics, Fantasies, Historical 
  Novels, Mysteries, Romances, Westerns, and novels for Young Adults. You can 
  browse these chapters to your heart's content, and in each one you'll find cross 
  listings so you can quickly locate every novel's primary description. You'll 
  also enjoy Sarver's whimsical illustrations. There are indexes at the back, 
  which identify the entries by Author, Title, and Subject. That means if you 
  want a novel about Shakespeare or stage managers or summer stock, you look in 
  the Subject Index and you're half way to ecstasy.</P>

<P><b>Finally</b> - If you visit the Barnes & Noble web site and do a search using 
  the key word "theatre arts," you'll discover over 2,000 titles - and that doesn't 
  cover audition books, scripts, criticism, et al. There is no such thing as being 
  too well-read. Happy Hunting!</P>
