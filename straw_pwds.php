<P><b>DANCE 10, LOOKS 3</b> is Val's showstopper from A Chorus Line. Following 
  is an edited version of her speech leading into the song:</p>

<blockquote>So, the day after I turned 18, I kissed the folks goodbye, got on a Trailways bus - and headed for the big bad apple. Cause I wanted to be a Rockette… Except I had one minor problem. See, I was ugly as sin. I was ugly, skinny, homely, unattractive and flat as a pancake. Get the picture? I had to wait 6 months for an audition. Well, finally the big day came. I showed up at the Music Hall with my red patent leather tap shoes. And I did my little tap routine. And this man said to me: Can you do fan kicks? - Well, sure I could do terrific fan kicks. But they weren't good enough. Of course, what he was trying to tell me was...it was the way I looked, not the fan kicks. Well, Broadway, same story. Every audition. I mean I'd dance rings around the other girls and find myself in the alley with the other rejects. But after a while I caught on. I mean I had eyes. I saw what they were hiring. I also swiped my dance card once after an audition. And on a scale of 10, they gave me for dance: 10. For looks: 3. Well...</blockquote>

<p><b>MOOSE MURDERS</b> - Written by Arthur Bicknell, Opened and closed on February 
  22, 1983</p>

<p>One might say that Moose Murders was the play that Max Bialystock should have produced for his get-rich-quick plan to work. Legendarily the worst turkey ever baked on Broadway, critics and theatrephiles alike claim boasting rights to having seen the show. But with a run of 13 previews and a single performance on opening night, how many people could actually have fit into the Eugene O'Neill? Following is an excerpt from Frank Rich's review in the New York Times:</p>

<blockquote>From now on, there will always be two groups of theatergoers in this world: those who have seen Moose Murders, and those who have not. Those of us who have witnessed the play that opened at the Eugene O'Neill Theatre last night will undoubtedly hold periodic reunions in the noble tradition of survivors of the Titanic. Tears and booze will flow in equal measure, and there will be a prize awarded to the bearer of the most outstanding antlers. As for those theatergoers who miss Moose Murders - well, they just don't rate. A visit to Moose Murders is what will separate the connoisseurs of Broadway disaster from mere dilettantes for many moons to come.</blockquote>

<P><b>WANDA RICHERT</b> was a 1981 Tony nominee for Best Featured Actress as Peggy 
  Sawyer in the first stage production of 42nd Street, which opened at the Winter 
  Garden Theatre on Broadway on August 25, 1980, directed & choreographed by Gower 
  Champion. On the web site broadwaystars.com, current revival choreographer Randy 
  Skinner is quoted in an interview with Ellis Nassour:</p>

<blockquote> "I didn't see her at our New York opening [at the Ford Center] or hear that she attended. After 42nd Street, she did a try-out of The Baker's Wife, then she went into Broadway's Nine as Carla, the role originated by Anita Morris. After that, unfortunately we lost touch."</blockquote>

<P><b>MISTER ROBERTS</b></P>
<p>Tony Award-winning play written by Thomas Heggen and Joshua Logan, based on Heggen's novel.  Henry Fonda starred on Broadway in 1948 and won the Tony for Best Actor and then went on to star in the film version in 1955 with James Cagney and William Powell. A young man by the name of Jack Lemmon made his film debut as Ensign Pulver and walked away with an Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor. The film was also nominated for Best Picture.</p>

<P><b>PANAMA HATTIE</b>, written by Herbert Fields and B.G. DeSylva with songs 
  by Cole Porter, was the first show that Ethel Merman carried on her shoulders 
  alone. It opened Oct 30, 1940 and ran for 501 performances. In 1942 a film version 
  was made starring Ann Southern, Red Skelton, and Rags Ragland, directed by Norman 
  Z. McLeod. One recognizable standard from the score: "Make It Another Old Fashioned."</p>

<p><b>BEATRICE LILLIE</b> (1894-1989) was a Canadian actress, singer, and comedienne 
  extraordinaire, often billed as " the funniest woman in the world." A contemporary 
  of Mary Pickford, her vaudevillian family moved to London, England where she 
  debuted in the West End at the age of 20. Lillie was a close friend of Noel 
  Coward, who called her " a comic genius of the first order." She made her Broadway 
  debut in 1924 and her career spanned more than four decades, with her last appearance 
  being in the musical comedy High Spirits. Her singing style was uniquely her 
  own, described as "utterly mad" and credited to "drunken fairies (who had) hit 
  her over the head with a golden hammer." Her film output was far less extensive 
  than her theatrical resume; her final screen credit, at 73 years old, was 1967's 
  Thoroughly Modern Millie.</p>

<P><b>LUCILLE LORTEL</b> (1900-1999), actress, producer, and theatre owner, probably 
  discovered and encouraged more theatre talent than any other American impresario 
  in her time. Nearly single-handedly she won for Off-Broadway the reputation 
  that it enjoys today. It is little wonder that in 1962 Richard L. Coe of the 
  Washington Post bestowed upon her the honorary title, "The Queen of Off-Broadway." 
  In 1947 she started the White Barn Theatre in Westport, Connecticut to showcase 
  new writers and established performers in an atmosphere free of commercial pressures. 
  In 1955, she acquired the Theatre de Lys (now called the Lucille Lortel Theatre) 
  in New York's Greenwich Village. </p>
<p>She traveled to Europe to see the innovative plays of Genet, Ionesco, Beckett, and Fugard, and took chances producing them when they had little or no international reputation. She also produced dramas by contemporary American playwrights, like Edward Albee, Anna Marie Barlow, Adrienne Kennedy, Terrence McNally, and Murray Schisgal. For over 50 years she worked tirelessly to make Off-Broadway a viable alternative to Broadway. </p>
<p>Those interested in Lucille Lortel's productions on Broadway and at the Lucille Lortel Theatre (formerly the Theatre de Lys) should consult the Theatre on Film and Tape Archive Material in the Lucille Lortel Room of the New York Library for the Performing Arts at Lincoln Center.</p>
